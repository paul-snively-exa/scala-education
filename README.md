# Scala Education

## Purpose

This repository is a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks demonstrating various aspects of programming in Scala. Being Jupyter notebooks, they are interactive, using the [Almond](http://almond.sh) kernel. The notebooks are being made available via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), so please feel free to run them, play with them, and offer pull requests for bug fixes and enhancements.
